## Settings

Moved to [settings](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Container

      $ docker-compose -f local.yml up

To seed data use the command

      $ docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py loaddata seed.json


### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

      $ docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

You will find the API documentation [here](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs/)

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django mypy journey

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django coverage run -m pytest
    $ docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django coverage html
    $ docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django open htmlcov/index.html

The last command is not executed, but you can see the report generated in the root directory.
#### Running tests with pytest

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django pytest
